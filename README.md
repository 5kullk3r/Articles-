# Articles-

Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub repository—a collection of articles, case studies, written by me  focused on real-world cybersecurity incidents and cyber-business-oriented analysis.

This is my personal learning space where I document and break down major security events, draw lessons from breaches, and explore how cybersecurity impacts organizations from both a technical and strategic lens.

📚 Why This Exists
I believe in learning through real-world context. By analyzing actual events—not simulations—I aim to better understand the landscape and share insights that others in the community can learn from too.
