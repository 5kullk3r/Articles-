# Articles-

Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub repository‚Äîa collection of articles, case studies, written by me  focused on real-world cybersecurity incidents and cyber-business-oriented analysis.

This is my personal learning space where I document and break down major security events, draw lessons from breaches, and explore how cybersecurity impacts organizations from both a technical and strategic lens.
